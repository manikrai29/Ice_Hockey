# Ice_Hockey

This is a part if Ice hockey game. Full code is not uploaded for privacy issues. In this project I basically focus on rendering and how gtraphics work. 6 different game menus and screens are created in this project with V/S mode as well (using AI). In this I am using Cmake and SFML libraries as well for graphics.  Below is the link to download the zip file of the game.                                           *******************Extract it and start playing. Also, to access the settings in game press "P" while in pause menu.***************


**********Also, dont change the dimentions of the playing screen (maximize or change size) cos then it willnot function properly. I am working on that and will fix that issue in V2 of this game *********
